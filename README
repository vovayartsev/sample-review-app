# Using Dockhero with Heroku Review Apps

Background: you can add Dockhero add-on to your app manifest to have this add-on in your
 Review Apps created automatically by Heroku for each pull request in Github.

## Problem

`dockhero-compose.yml` still needs to be deployed manually


## Solution

This is a proof-of-concept of a buildpack-based Dockhero automatic deployment approach.
It has lots of moving parts and could be turned into a separate buildpack down the road.

1. Create `app.json` in you Github repo to enable Review Apps. Mention `HEROKU_APP_NAME` as a required env variable - it's required for Dockhero operations.

2. Add two buildpacks to app.json: heroku-buildpack-apt and heroku/nodejs

3. Create Aptfile which instructs Heroku to install docker-ce and docker-compose

4. Create package.json with `dockhero` dependency and `postdeploy` script. This script is launched from `app.json` and performs the actual installation.
Notice `sleep 100` command there. It is required to give Dockhero addon enough time to provision itself (hack, needs to be improved in the future)

5. Create dockhero-compose.yml, e.g. via `heroku dh:generate helloworld`
